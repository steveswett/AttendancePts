REM  This works.

REM From Jeff Ash at Basis:
REM 
REM I would say to use the format YYYYmmDDHHMMSS. Use a type C(14).  So today's date at 5:30pm would look like this:
REM 
REM 20150713173000
REM 
REM This will be ordered naturally alphabetically and will hold all the info you would need.  There is a new date format going into 
REM 15.02 that will support using values stored in this format in SQL so by the time you switch over to BBj, you will be able to 
REM access these values as timestamps.


begin

FILE_NAME$ = "ATTEND_PTS_WORK"

REM  Column name max = 16
REM  DESCRIPTION - if underlines not used, BBj Enterpriser will ignore data after first blank space

REM  Since U(4) gives me SQL BIGINT and 20 char buffer, perhaps I should use N(10).  Actually type I gives 
REM  SQL INTEGER type and 10 char buffer, so using that.

    REM  VERY IMPORTANT: If a file contains binary fields, you have to be very careful about field delimiters -- since $0A$
    REM                  for delimiting could also naturally occur in a binary field.  For new tables, perhaps consider
    REM                  never using variable-length fields with delimiters -- and never specifying the "field" segment
    REM                  (first segment) in key definition list.
