REM  The above could start a workspace program like in the following comment, but it couldn't write to a shared screen.
REM  This is problematic when trying to do things interactively between Pro 5 and BBj.

REM begin
REM 
REM name$ = argv(1)
REM hobby$ = argv(2)
REM 
REM print "name$ = ", name$
REM print "hobby$ = ", hobby$
REM 
REM input @(0,22), "Hit any key", ignoreInput$
REM 
REM end

begin

name$ = argv(1)
hobby$ = argv(2)

print @(0,0),'CS'

print @(0,4),"name$ = ", name$
print @(0,6), "hobby$ = ", hobby$

input @(0,8), "Hit any key", ignoreInput$

end
